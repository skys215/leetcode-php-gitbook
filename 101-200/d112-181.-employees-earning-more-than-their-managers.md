# D112 181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers

[181. Employees Earning More Than Their Managers](https://leetcode.com/problems/employees-earning-more-than-their-managers/)

## 题目分析

给定一张表，返回工资比上级高的员工名字。

## 思路

我想到的是left join。

## 最终代码

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
#SELECT Employee.Name as Employee FROM Employee, Employee as Manager where Employee.ManagerId=Manager.Id and Employee.Salary>Manager.Salary;
SELECT Employee.Name as Employee FROM Employee LEFT JOIN Employee as Manager ON Employee.ManagerId=Manager.Id WHERE Employee.Salary>Manager.Salary;
```

但这语句只打败了12%的代码…很好奇该如何优化。
